# ケムシのごはん (Caterpiller Dinner)

A Game to practice the Japanese kanji for the numbers 0 - 10.

In order to have sound, add a directory called `sounds` and record 2 mp3 files
- boohoo.mp3 - a sad sound for the caterpiller to make when you get a question wrong
- yum.mp3 - a happy eating sound for the caterpiller to make when you get a question right

To Play
- The game will present a series of addition and subtraction questions using the kanji for the numbers 0 - 10.
- Select the answer using the kanji at the bottom of the screen (beware, they reorder randomly for each question).
- If you are right, the caterpiller grows
- If you are wrong, the caterpiller shrinks
- When you have 10 right, the caterpiller pupates.
- Then you can hatch the butterfly; for each 10 questions you get right a butterfly of a selection of - colours will appear.
